# C. Challenge Payment Question
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

- Monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- Upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- Upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- Once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
